# 6.4 后备模式

With the fallback pattern, when a remote service call fails, rather than generating an exception, the service consumer executes an alternative code path and tries to carry out the action through another means. The user’s call is not shown an exception indicating a problem, but they can be notified that their request will have to be tried later.
