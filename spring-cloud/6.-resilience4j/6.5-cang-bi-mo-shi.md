# 6.5 舱壁模式

When using the bulkhead pattern, you break the calls to remote resources into their own thread pools and reduce the risk that a problem with one slow remote resource call will take down the entire application.

The thread pools act as the bulkheads for your service. Each remote resource is segregated and assigned to a thread pool. If one service is responding slowly, the thread pool for that type of service call can become saturated and stop processing requests. Assigning services to thread pools helps to bypass this type of bottleneck so that other services won’t become saturated.
