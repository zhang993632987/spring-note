# 8. Securing

> All systems have vulnerabilities, but the big difference lies in whether these vulnerabilities are exploited and cause harm.

Securing a microservices architecture is a complex and laborious task that involves multiple layers of protection, including these:

The application layer—Ensures that the proper user controls are in place so that we can validate that a user is who they say they are and that they have permission to do what they’re trying to do

Infrastructure—Keeps the service running, patched, and up to date to minimize the risk of vulnerabilities

A network layer—Implements network access controls so that a service is only accessible through well-defined ports and only to a small number of authorized servers
