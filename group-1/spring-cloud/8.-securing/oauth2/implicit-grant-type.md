# Implicit grant type

With an implicit grant, you usually work with a pure JavaScript application running entirely inside a browser. With the other grant types, the client communicates with an application server that carries out the user’s request, and the application server interacts with any downstream services. With an implicit grant type, all service interactions happen directly from the user’s client (usually a web browser).

1. The owner of the JavaScript application registers the application with the O-stock OAuth2 server. The owner provides an application name and a callback URL that will be redirected with the OAuth2 access token for the user.
2. The JavaScript application calls the OAuth2 service. The JavaScript application must present a preregistered application name. The OAuth2 server then forces the user to authenticate.
3. If the user successfully authenticates, the O-stock OAuth2 service doesn’t return a token but, instead, redirects the user back to the page the owner of the JavaScript application registered in step 1. In the URL redirected back to the user, the OAuth2 access token is passed as a query parameter by the OAuth2 authentication service.
4. The application takes the incoming request and runs a JavaScript script that parses the OAuth2 access token and stores it (usually as a cookie).
5. Each time a protected resource is called, the OAuth2 access token is presented to the called service.
6. The called service validates the OAuth2 token and checks that the user is authorized to do the activity they’re attempting to do.

Keep several things in mind regarding the OAuth2 implicit grant type.&#x20;

* First, the implicit grant is the only grant type where the OAuth2 access token is directly exposed to a public client (web browser).
  * With the authorization grant type, the client application receives an authorization code returned by the application server hosting the application, and the user is granted an OAuth2 access by presenting the authorization code. The returned OAuth2 token is never directly exposed to the user’s browser.&#x20;
  * With the client credential grant type, the grant occurs between two server-based applications, and with the password grant type, both the application requesting a service and the services are trusted and owned by the same organization.
* OAuth2 tokens generated by the implicit grant type are more vulnerable to attack and misuse because the tokens are made available to the browser. Any malicious JavaScript running in the browser can access the OAuth2 access token and call the services you retrieved the OAuth2 token for on your behalf, essentially impersonating you. The implicit grant type OAuth2 tokens should therefore be short-lived (1–2hours). Because the OAuth2 access token is stored in the browser, the OAuth2 spec (and Spring Cloud security) doesn’t support the concept of a refresh token in which a token can be automatically renewed.
