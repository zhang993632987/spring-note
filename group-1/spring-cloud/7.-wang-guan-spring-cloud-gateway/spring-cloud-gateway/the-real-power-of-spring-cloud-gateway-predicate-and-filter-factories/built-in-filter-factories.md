# Built-in Filter Factories

The built-in Filter Factories allow us to inject policy enforcement points in our code and perform a wide number of actions on all service calls in a consistent fashion. In other words, these filters let us modify the incoming and outgoing HTTP requests and responses. Table 8.2 contains a list of all the built-in filters in Spring Cloud Gateway.
