# The real power of Spring Cloud Gateway: Predicate and Filter Factories

Because we can proxy all requests through the gateway, it allows us to simplify our service invocations. But the real power of the Spring Gateway comes into play when we want to write custom logic that will be applied against all the service calls flowing through the gateway. Most often, weâ€™ll use this custom logic to enforce a consistent set of application policies like security, logging, and tracking among all services.

These application policies are considered cross-cutting concerns because we want these strategies to be applied to all the services in our application without having to modify each one to implement them. In this fashion, the Spring Cloud Gateway Predicate and Filter Factories can be used similarly to Spring aspect classes. These can match or intercept a wide body of behaviors and decorate or change the behavior of the call without the original coder being aware of the change. While a servlet filter or Spring aspect is localized to a specific service, using the Gateway and its Predicate and Filter Factories allows us to implement cross-cutting concerns across all the services being routed through the gateway. Remember, predicates allow us to check if the requests fulfill a set of conditions before processing the request.

Figure 8.9 shows the architecture that the Spring Cloud Gateway uses while applying predicates and filters when a request comes through the gateway.

First, the gateway client (browsers, apps, and so forth) sends a request to Spring Cloud Gateway. Once that request is received, it goes directly to the Gateway Handler that is in charge of verifying that the requested path matches the configuration of the specific route it is trying to access. If everything matches, it enters the Gateway Web Handler that is in charge of reading the filters and sending the request to those filters for further processing. Once the request passes all the filters, it is forwarded to the routing configuration: a microservice.
